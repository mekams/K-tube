# Introduction
* This is a youtube clone which fetch the data using rapid API and only has basic version so limited API calls only (500/day).
* It has been divided in to 4 components and their sub components.
* Props drilling has been done in this project but for better improvement we can use context API or redux if adding more child components in future.

**I started from making the Navbar >SearchBar >SideBar >Feed > Videos > VideoCard >ChannelCard >ChannelDetail >VideoDetail >Loader**
## * -Functionalities added after making some components > retrieving again > adding funct.. > again retrieving
